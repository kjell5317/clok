# CLOK

clok is a refined and enhanced version of a time management/productivity application initially developed as a university project during the "Soft Skills und Technische Kompetenzen" (Soft Skills and Technical Competencies) course at the University of Oldenburg (WiSe 2021/2022). The original project's documentation can be found [here](https://wp.uni-oldenburg.de/soft-skills-und-technische-kompetenz-wise20212022-projektgruppe-13/) (german).

This improvement is currently under construction.
